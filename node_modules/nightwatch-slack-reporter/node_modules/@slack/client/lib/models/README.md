Slack API Models
================

JS model objects for the Slack API objects.

There are two flavors:
* [Slack](slack): objects directly representing [Slack API Types](https://api.slack.com/types)
* [Intermediary](intermediary): objects that are used in this library, but which don't exist in the Slack API Types
