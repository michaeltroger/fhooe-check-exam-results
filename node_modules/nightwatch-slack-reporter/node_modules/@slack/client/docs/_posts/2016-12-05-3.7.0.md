  * Don't know a user's ID? Want to find a DM with that user anyway? Now you can retrieve a DM from the memory store by username. Awesome.
  * API endpoints of the form `a.b.c` required a bit of rather tortured code to call. We have removed the torture requirements, and you can now call them as you might expect.
