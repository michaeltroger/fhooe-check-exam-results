  * Adds coveralls to the repo, to track code coverage and display a badge in the README
  * Updates the disconnect function on the RTM client to support both an error message and a code or reason for the disconnect, e.g. `account_inactive`
  * Updates the message-handlers for `team_xxx` events to set the team back to the data-store once changes are made
